Contributing Guidelines
-----------------------

Contributions to improve Vlege are welcomed from any and all persons, providing they meet a few simple rules:

  * **License as GPLv3+**, the same license as the project overall so it can be redistributed.
  * **Sign-off licensing** by using `git commit -s` for your "Merge Me" commit.
  * **Use Github Pull Request** so that it can be easily merged.
  * **Stick to PEP8** recommendations whenever possible and practical.
  * **Don't break code** in unsolicited requests. They will be closed mercilessly.
